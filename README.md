  - Rotation gates (Rx, Ry, Rz) support user input for angles.
- **Visualization**:
  - Displays the qubit's transformation on a Bloch sphere using Matplotlib.
  - Uses `qiskit.visualization.visualize_transition()` to animate state evolution.
- **Additional UI Components**:
  - **Gate Buttons:** Apply quantum operations.
  - **Display Area:** Shows applied gate sequence.
  - **Clear Button:** Resets the circuit.
  - **Visualize Button:** Displays the Bloch sphere.
  - **About Button:** Shows gate descriptions.

# Quantum Visualizer without Qiskit functions

## Overview
Quantum Visualizer is a Python-based application designed to help users understand single-qubit rotations on the Bloch Sphere. This application provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for applying quantum gates and visualizing their effects on a qubit's state.

## Features
- **Single-Qubit Quantum Circuit:** Simulates a qubit's state and applies quantum gates without using Qiskit.
- **Gate Operations:** Supports common quantum gates like X, Y, Z, H, S, T, and their inverse counterparts.
- **Rotation Gates:** Allows users to apply rotation gates (Rx, Ry, Rz) with user-defined angles.
- **Bloch Sphere Visualization:** Displays the qubit's state evolution on the Bloch sphere.
- **Interactive GUI:** Provides an easy-to-use interface using Tkinter.
- **Measurement:** Simulates quantum measurement to observe final probabilities.
